--How to deal with divide by zero errors in Big Query or SQL?

--Here is the syntax for that will give you divide by zero error:
WITH vars AS (
  SELECT (select count(*)FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` 
where extract (year from start_time) = 2021) as cte_total),--cet to get total rental for 2021

 zero as (---cte to set anything below 1000 to zero to show error
select start_station_name, case when count(*) < 1000 then 0
else count(*)
end as zero_total
from `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` 
where extract (year from start_time) = 2021

group by start_station_name )

select start_station_name, (select cte_total from vars)/zero_total as total
from zero

-----Using case statement:

WITH vars AS (
  SELECT (select count(*)FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` 
where extract (year from start_time) = 2021) as cte_total),--cet to get total rental for 2021

 zero as (---cte to set anything below 1000 to zero to show error
select start_station_name, case when count(*) < 1000 then 0
else count(*)
end as zero_total
from `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` 
where extract (year from start_time) = 2021

group by start_station_name )

select start_station_name, case when zero_total = 0 then null else (select cte_total from vars)/zero_total end as total
from zero


-------------------Using SAFE_DIVIDE:
WITH vars AS (
  SELECT (select count(*)FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` 
where extract (year from start_time) = 2021) as cte_total),--cet to get total rental for 2021

 zero as (---cte to set anything below 1000 to zero to show error
select start_station_name, case when count(*) < 1000 then 0
else count(*)
end as zero_total
from `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` 
where extract (year from start_time) = 2021

group by start_station_name )

select start_station_name, SAFE_DIVIDE((select cte_total from vars),zero_total) as total
from zero
