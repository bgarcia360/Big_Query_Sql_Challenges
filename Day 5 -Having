--How would you filter a query with aggregated function?

select start_station_name,count(*) as total,max(duration_minutes) as max_duration,min(duration_minutes) as min_duration, avg(duration_minutes) as avg_durtion,sum(duration_minutes) as sum_duration
FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` 
where extract (year from start_time) = 2021
group by start_station_name
having avg_durtion <= 30
order by avg_durtion
